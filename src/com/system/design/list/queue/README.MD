Implement a Queue using a Linked List

Design and implement a Queue using a singly linked list (with or without a dummy head node). The queue should support all standard operations with the same time and space complexity as a typical queue implemented using an array.

The implementation must maintain constant-time access to both the front and rear of the queue.


Required Operations and Complexities: <br>

| Operation | Description                         | Time Complexity |
| --------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------- |
| `offer()` | Insert an element at the end        | O(1)            |
| `peek()`  | Return the front element            | O(1)            |
| `poll()`  | Remove and return the front element | O(1)            |
| `size()`  | Get the number of elements          | O(1)            |
| `print()` | Print all elements in the queue     | O(n)            |
