Implement a Stack using a Linked List

The stack should support all standard operations with the same time and space complexity as a typical stack implemented using an array. The implementation should use a singly linked list (with or without a dummy head node) and maintain constant-time access to the top element.

Required Operations and Complexities: <br>

| Operation | Description                        | Time Complexity |
|-----------|------------------------------------|-----------------|
| push()    | Insert an element on top           | O(1)            |
| top()     | Return the top element             | O(1)            |
| pop()     | Remove and return the top element  | O(1)            |
| size()    | Get the number of elements         | O(1)            |
| print()   | Print all elements in the stack    | O(n)            |
